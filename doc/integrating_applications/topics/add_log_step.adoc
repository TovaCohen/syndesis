= Adding a log step

{prodname} provides information about each execution of an integration. 
To learn what information is automatically provided,
see <<viewing-integration-activity-information>>.

To obtain additional information, between any two steps, add a log step or a 
log connection to the integration. See link:{LinkFuseOnlineConnectorGuide}#comparison-log-step-connection_connect-to-log[Comparison of log step and log connection].

For each message that it receives, a log step can provide
one or more of the following:

* The message's header, which provides metadata about the message.
* The message's body, which provides the content of the message.
* Text that you specify either explicitly or through evaluation of an 
http://camel.apache.org/simple.html[Apache Camel Simple language] expression. 

To add a log step, you must be creating a new integration or
editing an integration. The integration must already have
its start and finish connections.

To finish an integration by logging information about the messages that an
integration processes, or to log message information at a particular log level,

instead of a log step. 

To add a log step:

. In the integration visualization panel on the left, hover over the
image:images/PlusSignToAddStepOrConnection.png[Plus Sign]
at the location where you want to add a log step.
. In the popup, click *Add a Step*.
. On the *Choose a Step* page, click *Log*.
. On the *Configure Log Step* page, select the content that you want
to log. If you select *Custom text*, then in the text input field, 
enter one of the following:
* The text that you want to log
* A Camel Simple language expression

+
If you enter an expression, {prodname} resolves the 
expression and logs the resulting text. 
. When log step configuration is complete, click *Done* to add the step
to the integration. 
. When the integration is complete, publish it to start seeing output
from the new log step.

* After an integration that has a log step has been executed, output from
its log step appears in the integration's *Activity* tab. See
