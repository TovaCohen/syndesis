experienced developer can create an extension that defines a custom
connector. For information about coding the 
extension and creating its `.jar` file, which you upload to 
{prodname}, see 
{LinkToolingUserGuide}#IgniteExtension[{NameOfToolingUserGuide}, Developing extensions for
{prodname} integrations] and
