[id='connecting-to-log']
= Connecting to an integration's log

:context: connect-to-log

For each integration step, {prodname} provides the following activity 
information:

* The date and time that the step was executed
* How long it took to execute the step
* Whether execution was successful
* The error message if execution was not successful

To view this information in {prodname}, display the integration's summary
and then click the *Activity* tab. See also:
link:{LinkFuseOnlineIntegrationGuide}#viewing-integration-activity-information[Viewing integration activity information].

To obtain further details about integration execution, you can 
log information about the messages that an integration processes by 
adding a log step and/or a log connection to an integration.
